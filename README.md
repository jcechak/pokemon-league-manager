        $ git pull

* Create your own branch with some appropriate name (e.g. name of the feature you are about to implement).

        $ git checkout -b name_of_the_branch

* Implement all the features, work on issues, fix all bugs, run all tests and closes all solved issues. Don't forget to commit regularly and possibly push your branch if it takes a while to implement.

        $ git commit -m "Describe what have you done." file_to_commit1 file_to_commit2 ...
        & git push

* When you are done with implementing, merge your branch with the master branch.

        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge name_of_the_branch

* Push your code to github repository for others to explore and enjoy.

        $ git push

* Close everything and feel proud of yourself and your accomplishment.
